Heya! This is the "official" modpack of the MLUX server. Most of these mods are simply replacements for optifine, so things like better looking grass, connected textures and most importantly way better performance (even better than optifine!). This pack also includes SimpleVoiceChat and it will be expanded with any future mods we might add to the server. Why release this as a modpack instead of just linking people to the mods? Because curseforge is an annoying website and it's very easy to accidentally end up installing the wrong version of a mod (especially for SimpleVoiceChat!), so we release this pack as "tried and tested" for our server.



IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MACOS USERS:
At the current time SimpleVoiceChat seems to have some compatibility issue with (an)other mod(s) on macOS systems, meaning it won't fully work, and doing the quite complicated install will only make your experience worse. As our testing has proven inconclusive we recommend you to not install the mod (simply delete it from the "MLUXmods" folder before starting the instructions) and to use discord or another voice chat program until we figure out the issue / until the issue gets fixed by the developers of the mod. Sorry for the inconvenience!



INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open fabric-installer-0.10.2.jar (if it doesn't open, drag it out of this folder, into your downloads and try again).

2. Change minecraft version from 1.18.2 to 1.18.1.

3. Press install.

4. Open up the minecraft launcher.

4. To the left of the play button it should say "fabric-loader-1.18.1". If it doesn't, try clicking on what it is saying (probably something like "Latest release") and change it over to the fabric loader.

5. Start minecraft.

6. When minecraft has started to the main menu, quit the game. This is needed for the fabric loader to initialise some files and folders it needs.

7. locate your mods folder. For Windows this should be in "%appdata%\.minecraft\" (remove the quotes and enter this in explorer). For MacOS it is in "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft". Press cmd+shift+G when in finder and paste the text between the quotes.

8. Copy all the mods from the "MLUXmods" folder to the "mods" folder in minecraft.

9. Start the game again.

10. The last thing you've got to do is to enable the continuity resource pack and tweak the settings of the mods to your liking. After this you should be ready to go! If you get any errors, or you don't understand a part of this guide, leave a message in the discord. Both a message in general or a DM to an admin are acceptible.

We obviously didn't create the mods ourself, so what will follow is a link to every mod included in this pack. If you are wondering what a mod does you can follow the link and read the description on the website. You can also check out the mods links and settings (if applicable) in the "mods" menu which you can access from the homepage or from the pause menu.
